    <p class="lead">Follow Rugby has been designed to make it easier for anyone interested in rugby to follow its key developments on Twitter.</p>

    <p>The data has been organised into relevant widget groupings so you can see the latest real time updates - simply interact as you would on Twitter: follow, mention, reply, retweet, favorite etc!</p>

    <p>Our Match Centre provides head to head widgets of both teams, which allows you to see the perspective of both sides during the match. A widget for the match #hashtag is also shown – join in the match conversation. The match centre will be updated before each round of major matches and is a great way to follow live score and key action updates on the internet.*</p>
